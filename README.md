# CR-10S4-Firmware
This repository is an extension of my website where I created a guide on how to install a new CR-10S4 Motherboard Replacement V2.1. From my experience, Creality tends to not keep up to date with url's where they provide helpful resources, and so I have added them to my github to be easily accessible at any time.
